# Why did we reset?
When we were attempting to clean up the workspace we accidentally deleted the generated dll's. Those DLLs are generated when the project was made so we can not reconstruct them
# How long will it take to work again? 
We are completely restarting the project on the same repository. We will have all the same developers, names, info, and base. The UI will be completely redisgned and a lot more interactive and less static. This should be a lot quicker as there are better developers than myself. So about 1-2 Weeks
# Will there be anything new?
